# Store-Sales-Prediction-Analysis
#For this project, I'll be working with "Womart," leading nutrition and supplement retail chain that offers a comprehensive range of products for wellness and fitness needs.

The purpose of this notebook will be to predict the number of sales for each store to provide the stores with essential insights into the upcoming inventory and cash flow for the following months.

The dataset that they provided contains the information of sales of the past 18 months along with:

ID: Unique identifier for a row

Store id: Unique id for each store

Store type: Type of the store

Location type: Type of the location where the store is located

Region Code: Code of the region where the store is located
